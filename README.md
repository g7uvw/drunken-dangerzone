==================

Just a collection of installed libraries and code I'm hacking on on various locations, it's handy to have a master version (with change tracking) somewhere accessible. 

I make no promises for the usability of any of the code you find here. There's a good chance it was written to scratch a particular itch I had at some point. Or was written drunk. Or was started and given up on before it ever did anything useful. Or all of the above at the same time.

There is code here which was written by other people - I'm not claiming it as mine. It's mostly in the libraries. If there's something here of yours and you don't want it here, let me know and I'll remove it (or credit you, if I haven't already).

The git repo name was auto-suggested by github, it was too good and too apt to pass up.

Some of the code backs up projects on my website, http://webshed.org
